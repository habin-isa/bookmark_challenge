# Bookmark Challenge #

This web application has been designed to maintain a collection of bookmarks.
Users are able to save useful URLs and tag them in order to find them later on.
Additionally you can browse bookmarks that other users have added and comment on them.

Before building this project we created user stories and domain models.

```
As someone who does not have a up to date browser
I would like to see my favourite websites

As someone who has bad download speeds and cant download chrome
I would like to be able to add my favourite websites
I would like to be able to see these websites in my list
