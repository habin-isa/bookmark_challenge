# Bookmark Challenge #

This web application has been designed to maintain a collection of bookmarks.
Users are able to save useful URLs and tag them in order to find them later on.
Additionally you can browse bookmarks that other users have added and comment on them.

Before building this project we created user stories and domain models.
